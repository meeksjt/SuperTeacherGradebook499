# Instructor Grading Program  
### Team Members: Tyler Meeks, Christopher Carter, Jacob Houck, Matthew Stewart

##### Rationale:  
In academic institutions, instructors assign numeric and/or letter grades to student assignments. 
Most instructors use a spread sheet application such as Microsoft Excel. 
Some instructors still record grades manually in a grade book and use hand-held calculators to calculate final grades at the end of each term. 
A need has been identified for a grading program that will not only take care of all calculations, but will also serve to support additional instructor needs with respect to grading.
